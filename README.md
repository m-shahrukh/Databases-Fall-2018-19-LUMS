# Databases-Fall-2018-19-LUMS
Our course project was a Blood Bank Management system. Back-end in SQL with front-end in Python Flask API.

The project was my first real introduction to Databases and full stack development. It's a localhost project and it's my first time using the flask API. It was a fun API to use in python, a language I was more comfortable with at the time compared to other other front-end web development languages. 


Files: 
BBMS.py- Python file that deals with the back-end code for the project. It uses MySQL and flask. 
procedures.txt- contains the stored procedures we created within our MYSQL server.
queries.txt- All queries we implemented according to the queries given to us, they can be found in BBMS.py too.
sql_schema.sql- SQL schema
Blood Bank Queries.pdf- The Queries we were supposed to implement.
templates folder- All the html files that we used.
Final Document.docx- The final deliverable containing all the information from the schema diagrams, to normalization, to ER diagrams and query outputs.
