# Databases-Fall-2018-19-LUMS
Our course project was a Blood Bank Management system. Back-end in SQL with front-end in Python Flask API.

The project was my first real introduction to Databases and full stack development. It's a localhost project and it's my first time using the flask API. It was a fun API to use in python, a language I was more comfortable with at the time compared to other other front-end web development languages.
